# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The documentation is deployed [here](https://yoop-docs.netlify.app). It deploys from the latest commit hash on main. Feature branches are not deployed.

When contributing, make sure you create a new branch of your documentation updates and open a PR to merge your branch into main.
