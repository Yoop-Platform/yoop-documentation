# Getting Started

## Clone the repository

Navigate to the directory you want to to store your projects.

Execute the following command to clone the documentation repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yoop-Platform/yoop-documentation.git
```

## Installation and starting up Docusaurus

To install all the dependencies, you'll need Node.js installed. Navigate to the newly cloned directory and use:

```bash
npm install
```

to install the required dependencies.

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm run start
```

After running the server, you can open a new terminal and use:

```bash
git branch -b <name-of-your-new-branch>
```

to create a new branch and to start editing the documentation.

P.S. Use whatever you feel comfortable with, whether it's to create a new branch or manage dependencies. You should also be able to use yarn, as far as I know, if you hate npm.
