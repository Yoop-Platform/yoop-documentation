# Creating Repositories

We'll probably use a lot of repositories for this project.

For actual services that are going to be used let's use `yoop-[service-name]`.

For services that are going to be mocked until we get a final service working, let's use `yoop-mock-[service-name]`.

For services that are going to be just proof of concepts and are not even going to be used as mocks, let's use `yoop-poc-[service-name]`.
